### Jumbotron Code

```
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
  <div class="container">
    <h1 class="display-4">Fluid jumbotron</h1>
    <p class="lead">This is a modified jumbotron that occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
* Why did I use this code?

This helps make styling the webpage a little easier. We can focus more on the artsy side of things rather than just the coding :)

* How does the code do what it does?

This code access bootstraps css file where specific color and dimensions are used as a container and displayed. Bootstrap sets a
specific size and motion of the container as well. Such as, when the webpage size decreases, it is still acessible in a legible format.
Essentially, bootstrap has pre-defined colors and classes that get applied when you call them. This makes coding easy and focuses more
on the backend and logistics.

* Licensing?

No licensing.

### Form Code

```
<form>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="exampleFormControlSelect2">Example multiple select</label>
    <select multiple class="form-control" id="exampleFormControlSelect2">
      <option>1</option>
      <option>2</option>
      <option>3</option>
      <option>4</option>
      <option>5</option>
    </select>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="exampleFormControlTextarea1">Example textarea</label>
    <textarea class="form-control" id="exampleFormControlTextarea1" rows="3"></textarea>
  </div>
</form>

Here, class = "form-group" creates a layout for the forms and organizes them in certain way. "form-control" sets a style for the type
of input used, here it was a textarea.

        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>

  <div class="col-sm-6">

Here, class = "card" defines a special container that can be used to display information. class = "card-body" signifies the body
of this container type. class = "card-text" signifies that this is the text that goes into the body of the card.
